# Trends and Future-Prediction

Welcome to my project page! This project explores alcohol-related mortality trends and uncovers key insights into the factors driving these trends. Using data analysis and visualizations, the project aims to highlight important patterns and provide valuable information to guide public health decisions.

## **What Is This Project About?**

This project looks at alcohol-specific deaths in the United Kingdom, answering key questions like:
1. **What are the trends in alcohol-related deaths over time?**
2. **Which age groups and regions are most affected?**
3. **What are the main causes of alcohol-related deaths?**
4. **Can we use data to predict future trends?**

## **Key Findings**

- **Alcoholic Liver Disease** is the leading cause of alcohol-specific deaths, responsible for over 70% of fatalities.
- **Middle-aged individuals (ages 45â€“64)** are the most at risk, with rising death rates since 2015.
- **Regional Differences**:
  - **England** has the highest number of deaths overall.
  - **Scotland** shows the highest per-capita mortality rate.
- **Trends**: Alcohol-specific deaths have been steadily increasing in recent years, especially in high-risk groups.

## **Why Does This Matter?**

Understanding alcohol-specific mortality is crucial for:
- **Policymakers**: Developing targeted interventions for high-risk groups and regions.
- **Healthcare Providers**: Prioritizing resources to address the leading causes of alcohol-related deaths.
- **Public Awareness**: Educating individuals about the risks and trends of alcohol consumption.
